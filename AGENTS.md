- Cloud games default to the standalone /play view to avoid mounting the app shell during gameplay; keep inline playback as an explicit fallback.
- Use only verified provider-native graphics controls; FivePlay profiles live in the shared game-performance module so other providers never receive invented engine flags.
- Gameplay's lightweight styling is temporary and must not overwrite the user's saved appearance preferences.
- Console Mode uses isolated authenticated console routes and shared navigation/library modules; skin screens compose them without changing classic or launcher layouts.
- Console games reuse the shared cloud catalog and regular-game player; local per-user installation state stores stable catalog IDs, while console appearance stays in the existing preferences store.

- Browser proxy transports must live inside `createClientOnlyFn` so Worker module initialization never evaluates browser WASM transport packages.
- Opening choices and explicit account confirmation are document-scoped through VisitProvider; persisted preferences or restored auth sessions never mark a new visit complete, and standalone gameplay bypasses this flow.
- Shared authentication and arcade views live in components rather than exported route components, preventing route splitting from pulling browser-only dependencies into the server entry.
