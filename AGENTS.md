- Cloud games default to the standalone /play view to avoid mounting the app shell during gameplay; keep inline playback as an explicit fallback.
- Use only verified provider-native graphics controls; FivePlay profiles live in the shared game-performance module so other providers never receive invented engine flags.
- Gameplay's lightweight styling is temporary and must not overwrite the user's saved appearance preferences.
- Console Mode uses isolated authenticated console routes and shared navigation/library modules; skin screens compose them without changing classic or launcher layouts.
